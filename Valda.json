No matter their means, every necromancer is driven by a deep fascination with the dark arts and the power necromancy can afford them. Most see themselves as outcast members of the academic elite, braving new dark territories of magic that other spellcasters are too cowardly to explore.",
                "However, collecting knowledge expanding their understanding is merely a means to an end for most necromancers—they are almost always driven by a deeper, darker impulse, a goal which pushes them to the utter brink. This might be the perverted ideal of a “greater good” or a goal to right the wrong of mortality; in every case, necromancy is a grim implement for their life’s work."
